# OBJECTIVE
In this press your luck game, points to win. You score points based on the total number value of the cards in front of you. The more valuable a card is, the more copies of that card there are in the deck. If you can successfully Flip 7 unique Number cards into your line, you automatically end the round for everyone and score 15 bonus points. However, if you ever draw a second card with the same number as one already in your line, you bust and are out of the round, scoring nothing.

# IMPORTANT

THIS IS A SPECIAL DECK OF CARDS.

It has twelve 12’s, eleven 11’s, ten 10’s… until you get to one 1; there is even one 0.
There are also a few Action and Modifier cards: Flip Three, Freeze, Second Chance, and Score Modifiers.
When playing the game, it is important to keep the card count in mind.

# How to Play

Shuffle the deck thoroughly and choose a player to be the Dealer for the round.

## Gameplay

### Dealing

1. In turn order, the Dealer deals one card face up to each player including themselves.

2. If an Action card appears during dealing, pause dealing immediately to resolve it.

3. Once resolved, continue dealing until everyone has a card.

**Important:**

- Not everyone will have a Number card at this point.

- Some players may have a Number or Modifier card, while others may have no cards or multiple cards depending on Action cards.

### Player Options

- Each player, in turn, may Hit (get another card) or Stay (exit the round and bank their points).

- If you Hit, place Number cards in a row with Score Modifier cards above them.

- You may Stay as long as you have a card in front of you.

### Example Round

- Number card score: 11 + 5 + 12 = 28

- With a +4 bonus card: 28 + 4 = 32 points

**Reminder:**

- Action or Modifier cards do not count toward the 7-card bonus. The only way to achieve the Flip 7 bonus is by having seven unique Number cards face up in front of you.

### The Action Cards

- Action cards may be played on any active player, including yourself.

- If you are the only active player, you must play the Action card on yourself.

- Place these cards above your Number cards.

**Active Player Definition:**
- If you haven’t Busted or chosen to Stay, you are an active player.

#### Freeze!

- The player receiving this card banks all points they have and is out of the round.

#### Flip Three!

- The player must accept the next three cards, flipping them one at a time.

- Stop flipping if the player has flipped 7 Number cards or if they Bust.

- Number, Action, and Modifier cards count toward the three.

- If a Second Chance appears, it may be set aside for use.

- If another Flip Three or Freeze is revealed, resolve them after all three cards are drawn.

#### Second Chance!

- Keep this card. If the player receives a duplicate Number card, discard the duplicate and this card.

- A player may only have one Second Chance at a time. If dealt another, give it to another active player, or discard it if no eligible players exist.

- All unused Second Chance cards are discarded at the end of the round.

- They may also be discarded if the player draws a Freeze card or achieves Flip 7.

### The Modifier Cards

- Modifiers are not Number cards and do not count toward Flip 7.

- You cannot bust on Modifier cards.

- You can end your turn with only Modifier cards and still score them, unless it’s ×2 (which requires Number cards).

**+2 to +10 Cards:** Add the amount to the sum of your Number cards.

**×2 Card:** Double the total of your Number cards.

Note: First multiply your Number cards by 2, then add additional Modifier bonuses.

### End of a Round

The round ends when:

1. No active players remain (everyone Busted or chose Stay).
    - To mark inactive, flip your cards face down.

2. A player flips 7 unique Number cards (round ends immediately).
    - This player earns an additional +15 point bonus.

### Scoring

- Add the value of Number cards.

- Apply ×2 if present.

- Add any additional bonus points (+2 to +10).

- If Flip 7, add +15 bonus.

### Starting the Next Round

- Set aside all cards from the round (do not shuffle them back in).

- Pass the remaining deck to the next Dealer (left).

- When the deck runs out, shuffle all discarded cards to form a new deck.

- If reshuffling mid-round, leave all active cards where they are.

### End of the Game

- The game ends when at least one player reaches 200 points at the end of a round.

- The player with the most points wins.
